So this game is COMPLETELY unfinished. Literally all thats done is the menu lol (as of 16/02/25) but if ur so desperate to try it (why???) then follow these steps i guess????????

-Download the zip file (latest version recommended, or download previous ones if you wanna go back versions. The versions will be labelled.)
-Extract the files.
-Run "Project TCOAIK"

Windows Firewall may block the program (It did for me when I tried it). If it does so, simply click "More info" then "Run anyway" or whatever it says.
If a different firewall blocks it, then just skip it.
