So this game is COMPLETELY unfinished. Literally all thats done is the menu lol (as of 16/02/25) but if ur so desperate to try it (why???) then follow these steps i guess????????

DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS - WINDOWS
-Click the "TCOAIK - v0.0.0_development" file, then click the "download raw" button. The zip file will start downloading.
-Extract the files.
-Run "Project TCOAIK"

I will find out the mobile instructions. Once I try them, I will add them here!

Windows Firewall may block the program (It did for me when I tried it). If it does so, simply click "More info" then "Run anyway" or whatever it says.
If a different firewall blocks it, then just skip it.
